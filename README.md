# Trapelibre 
An Open Source Application to assit Restaurants, Cafes, and Bars

## What is Trapelibre?
Currently nothing. But the plan is for Trapelibre to become a helpful
application for places like restaurants and cafes. It will provide an
application to the servers and to the kitchen / bar staff to send
orders, manage them, etc. In the future, it may or may not support 
features such as per-table tablet applications for the customers to
order their dishes or call for the waiters without effort.
